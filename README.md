# Sentiment-Analysis

Introduction
Have you ever read a tweet and thought, “Gee, what a positive outlook!” or “Wow, why so negative, friend?”  Can computers make the same determination?  They can surely try!

In Machine Learning, the task of assigning a label to a data item is called classification (putting things into different classes or categories).  The more specific name for what we’re going to do is sentiment analysis because you’re trying to determine the “sentiment” or attitude based on the words in a tweet.  Project builds a sentiment classifier! Aren’t you excited??  ( ← That would be positive sentiment!)

Given a set of tweets called the training data set that are already pre-classified by humans as positive or negative based on their content.  The program analyzis the frequency of occurrences of words in the tweets to develop a classification scheme.  Using the classification scheme, it is then classified into another set of tweets called the testing data set and predict if each tweet has positive sentiment or negative sentiment.
